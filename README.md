# project_jewelery_shop
E-commerce jewelery. I used here Vanilla js, PHP, jQuery, ajax, scss preprocessor.
I`ve made only the most functional blocks (Shopping page, main page, shopping bag, product description and so on).
First of all you have to download the project, then find txt file jewelery_shop_database and enter commands to PHPmyAdmin SQL command line.
Finally, enjoy (or not) my website :)
